# 🧬 Skin Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of skin disorders based on medical features. The goal is to assist dermatologists and healthcare professionals by providing an intelligent, data-driven diagnostic tool.

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `skin_disorder_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code for preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- (Optional) `skin_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To train a classification model that can predict the type or presence of a skin disorder based on clinical or image-based features, improving the speed and reliability of early diagnosis.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- Features include:
  - Skin thickness
  - Itching, redness, or lesion severity
  - Family history, medication history
  - Blood test results (if applicable)
- Target variable: Disorder category (e.g., psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, etc.)
