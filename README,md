# Crunch Predictions 📊🍪

This project builds a machine learning model to predict "crunch" outcomes (classification or regression, depending on the data), using structured input features.

## 📁 Files Included
- `crunch_predictions.ipynb`: Contains full code for data preprocessing, EDA, model building, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and testing
- Accuracy and metric evaluation

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🧠 Outcome
Built a prediction model that can classify or forecast the crunch-level (depending on dataset target), useful for business insights or industrial applications.

## 🙋‍♂️ Role
- Sole developer: Handled data processing, ML modeling, and results visualization.
